These wetlands likely provide critical habitat for diverse species and offer flood protection. Solar development could disrupt hydrology, wildlife corridors, and potentially release sediments into waterways. The site appears to be in the San Francisco area, suggesting high land value and possible alternative locations. Recommendations include seeking alternative locations, conducting environmental impact studies, incorporating buffer zones (minimum 100m), using elevated panel designs to maintain ground vegetation, and implementing comprehensive stormwater management plans.',
